# FileExplorer
FileExplorer is a simple command-line file management system implemented in C++. It allows users to create, modify, and manage files and directories in a hierarchical structure, similar to a traditional file system. This project is designed to demonstrate basic file operations, directory navigation, and data persistence through serialization.
